I am a Master of Science in Analytics candidate at the University of Chicago with professional experience in the field of data analytics. I work to manage and organize data, process and perform data analyses, develop and test statistical models, and gain and improve business insights.

This repository contains portfolio of data science projects completed for professional, academic, and self-learning purposes.


Programming languages:
  - **Python**: numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, opencv, seaborn, matplotlib
  - **R**: copula, data.table, dplyr, ggplot2

Other tools:
  - **SQL**, **Tableau**

## Contents
- ## Machine Learning
    - [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/credit_card_fraud_detection): .
    - [Divvy Bike Prediction](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/divvy_bike_prediction): The prediction can help Divvy pre-allocate bikes to avoid bike shortage in any divvy bike station. Logistic regression is used to categorize busy and not-busy stations, and the model can be run on a daily basis.

- ## Data Mining
    - [Anomalies Detection: Based on Copulas and Quantile Regression](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/anomalies_detection_based_on_copulas_and_quantile_regression): .
    - [Non-Hierarchical Clustering: Comparison between K-Means and DBSCAN](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/non_hierarchical_clustering_comparison_between_k_means_and_dbscan): .
    
- ## Deep Learning & Image Recognition
    - [Driver Assistance System](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/driver_assistance_system): Focused on processing videos taken from the front camera mounted on test vehicle's windshield. The system generates real-time steering angle recommendation, lane keep status, and brake warning message when necessary.
    - [Real-Time Video Surveillance Detection](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/real_time_video_surveillance_detection): The goal of this project is to detect train movement in surveillance videos.
    - [Color Change Detection](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/color_change_detection): This project can be used to find critical changes in color and tone in videos.

- ## Data Visualization
    - [Divvy Bike Usage](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/divvy_bike_usage): Data visualizations that discover factors, including customer groups, bike station location, weather, and traffic, that will impact bike rentals.
    
- ## Database Design
    - [Sakila Database](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/sakila_database): Constructed a snowflake dimemsional data model using sakila database schema which can be found at mysql website.

- ## Statistics Concepts
    - [Maximum Likelihood](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/maximum_likelihood): .

- ## Other
    - [TCP Server and Client](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/tcp_server_and_client): Created a TCP server using the library socketserver and threaded TCP clients.
    - [Trading Strategy](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/trading_strategy): Built a market neutral strategy using airline stocks including Alaska, American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines, downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
