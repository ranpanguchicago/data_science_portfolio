## Contents
- ## Machine Learning
    - [Divvy Bike Prediction](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/divvy_bike_prediction): The prediction can help Divvy pre-allocate bikes to avoid bike shortage in any divvy bike station. Logistic regression is used to categorize busy and not-busy stations, and the model can be run on a daily basis.

- ## Deep Learning & Image Recognition
    - [Driver Assistance System](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/driver_assistance_system): This project focuses on processing videos taken from the front camera mounted on test vehicle's windshield. The system generates real-time steering angle recommendation, lane keep status, and brake warning message when necessary.
    - [Real-Time Video Surveillance Detection](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/real_time_video_surveillance_detection): The goal of this project is to detect train movement in surveillance videos.
    - [Color Change Detection](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/color_change_detection): This project can be used to find critical changes in color and tone in videos.

- ## Data Analysis
    - [Trading Strategy](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/trading_strategy): Built a market neutral strategy using airline stocks including American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta, downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
    
- ## Data Visualization
    - [Divvy Bike Usage](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/divvy_bike_usage):.
    
- ## Database Design
    - [Sakila Database](https://github.com/ranpanguchicago/sakila_database):.
